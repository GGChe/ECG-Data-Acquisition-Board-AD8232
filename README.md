# ECG_DataAcquisition
This is a project done at the University of Malaga during a final Project Report. The aim of this project is to develope a ECG, a device that can measure the heart's electrical signal generated during the systole and diastole of atriums and ventricles of this human organ. After obtaining that data, a signal processing was made in order to obtain the peak rate and then a possible control or action can be made after detecting an anomalous process.
