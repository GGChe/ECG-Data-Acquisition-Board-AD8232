# ECG_DataAcquisition
This is a project done at the University of Malaga during a final Project Report. The aim of this project is to develope a ECG, a device that can measure the heart's electrical signal generated during the systole and diastole of atriums and ventricles of this human organ. After obtaining that data, a signal processing was made in order to obtain the peak rate and then a possible control or action can be made after detecting an anomalous process.

Nowadays, sedentary and bad living habits are causing serious problems in the health of the human population. Among these serious changes is the evident lack of cardiovas-cular health of the population as shown by oÿcial statistics and the growing number of electromedical devices to treat cardiovascular diseases. This project constitutes an ap-proach to the design and production process of an electromedical device such as an analog electrocardiograph which, communicated with an Arduino development board, allows the acquisition and processing of an electrocardiogram signal. Thus, a thorough biological and electronic research is carried out in order to justify each phase of the device development process. Subsequently, the di˙erent stages of the project are presented, from the taking of requirements to the final manufacture of the device and the relevant tests. This project highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary work that includes various areas of work such as the medical and electronic.

The project is written in Spanish language. Anyway, the formal data and code can be read perfectly as well as the pictures given.
