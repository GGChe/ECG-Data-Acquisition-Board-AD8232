Here you will find the MATLAB code generated for the data signal processing. It is based on the Pan-Tompkins algorythm. 

The code is commented so you can just read what it does! But generally, it reads the data from the data.log written in .txt. Then,
it is converted into a vector. That array of data is all the data taken during the sample time. 

After having all the date storaged in an array of data, we need to filter all of that data. Different filters are applied, based on the 
filter criteria of the Pan-Tompkins algorythm (Tompkins, P. & Pan, J., 1985)
